# Shame calculator

Basic arithmetic calculations with a unique twist â€” it incorporates a shame bar that increases upon incorrect predictions. Users can input mathematical expressions, make predictions, and experience consequences for incorrect guesses, fostering a gamified learning environment. The application also features visual cues, such as displaying images, to enhance the user experience based on their performance.

## What for? 

This Java calculator study project is designed for educational purposes to enhance my understanding of Java Swing components and component programming concept. It provides a simple graphical user interface (GUI) for performing basic operations with multiple functionalities and non-functionalities.

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.

## Running the Calculator
Compile Java files
```bash
javac src/Calculator.java src/CalculatorController.java
```
Run the program
```bash
java src.Calculator
```

## 10 Functionalities
1. Basic Calculation:

Allows users to perform basic arithmetic calculations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
2. Result Display:

Displays the result of the calculation in a designated field.
3. Prediction Input:

Accepts user predictions for the calculation result.
4. Shame Bar:

Represents the user's correctness in predictions.
5. Streak Recognition:

Recognizes consecutive correct predictions and rewards the user.
6. Meme Display:

Shows a meme to the user as a break from calculations.
7. Shame Image:

Displays a shame image when the Shame Bar reaches its maximum.
8. Good Job Recognition:

Recognizes when the user achieves three correct predictions in a row and rewards them.

## 20 Non-functionalities
1. Welcome Message:

Displays a random welcoming message when the application starts.
2. Color Feedback:

Changes the color of the prediction field to green for correct predictions and red for incorrect predictions.
3. Proximity Display:

Displays the proximity value when the user makes a prediction.
4. Help and About Information:

Provides information about using the calculator and details about the application.
5. User Interface Layout:

Defines the layout and appearance of the graphical user interface (GUI).
6. Image Icons:

Uses images (icons) for the Shame Bar, Good Job recognition, shame image, and memes.
